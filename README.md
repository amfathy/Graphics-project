# Graphics project

## Description

"This project is a graphical application using WinAPI that demonstrates various algorithms for drawing lines, circles, and ellipses, as well as flood fill algorithms. It provides a user interface to visualize the drawing algorithms in action."

## Features

- Line drawing algorithms (e.g., DDA, Bresenham's line algorithm)
- Circle drawing algorithms (e.g., Polar, Midpoint)
- Ellipse drawing algorithms (e.g., Midpoint, Polar)
- Flood fill algorithms (e.g., Recursive, Non-recursive)
- Convex polygon filling using the scan-line algorithm

## Usage

- **Line Drawing**: To draw a line from point (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), use the `DrawLine` function with the appropriate parameters.
- **Circle Drawing**: To draw a circle with center (xc, yc) and radius r, use the `DrawCircle` function.
- **Flood Fill**: To fill an area starting from (x, y) with a new color, use the `FloodFill` function.
